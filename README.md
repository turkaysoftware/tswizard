# How to use TS Wizard?

After downloading the TS Wizard application, you will find two options: **TSWizard_x64.exe** and **TSWizard_arm64.exe**. Which file to choose depends on your computer’s processor architecture. Here’s a guide to help you decide which version is right for you:

#### 1. TSWizard_x64.exe
- **TSWizard_x64.exe** is designed for computers with an x64 (64-bit) processor architecture.
